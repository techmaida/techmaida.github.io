        Hello there !!! 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This is me on the left, live and in colors. It's a pleasure to have you here. Welcome to the Tech Maida !
        <br/>
        <br/>
        By the way, my name is João Paulo Maida. I work with IT since 2008 and currently am a Senior Middleware Consultant at Red Hat. 
        I like to develop software and architecture solutions. Read, write, videogames, family and enjoy my time on this Earth are in my hobby list too.

        I've written this book on the right and you can buy it clicking <a href="https://www.casadocodigo.com.br/products/livro-teoria-dos-grafos">here</a>. 
        There I present the Graph Theory using my point of view to ease the understanding in general and to introduce algorithms focused on this area. 
        Math can be easy as walking on the street, right ?!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Once again, it's honor to have you here. At the top you can find all my social media. Feel free to use and enjoy this website.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        João Paulo Maida
