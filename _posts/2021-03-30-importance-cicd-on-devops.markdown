Understand the importance of CI/CD on DevOps is one of the major goals to be achieved when a company decides to implement the truthful DevOps. But, why's that ?

Why do I have to understand the importance about this and why do I have the obligation to understand first what is CI/CD ? Of course, I am assuming that you know what DevOps is. But when I say "DevOps", I mean the truthful one. I am not referring to those cases where companies buy the most top existing tools on the market and think that all problems will be solved by these tools. I think, by my experience, that understand what DevOps really is the biggest challenge to be persued. That is the place where all the eyes should be and implement CI/CD comes next. So, this is my goal with this article, bring my point of view about what I believe to be DevOps, CI/CD and really understand what is the importance mentioned in article title.

So, what is DevOps ? In a really fast search on Google we can find the definition below:

"_DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from Agile methodology._"

But the point is: this definition doesn't help at all. Of course it doesn't help, it's to vague and of course it is vague, it's a cutout from Wikipedia. What were you expecting ? However, even if it is vague, it tells us some important things. DevOps wasn't born from one day to another. It has its foundations in others methodologies, as:
* Lean;
* Agile Manifest;
* Agile Infrastructure and Velocity Moviment;
* Continuous Delivery;
* Toyota Kata;

As you can see, it goes way further than a simple definition. Understand this methodologies is the key to understand DevOps and embrace it. I usually say that DevOps is a culture, but not only a culture, it is a lifestyle.
