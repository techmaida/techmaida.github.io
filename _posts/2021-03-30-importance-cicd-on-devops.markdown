Understand the importance of CI/CD on DevOps is one of the major goals to be achieved when a company decides to implement the truthful DevOps. But, why's that ?

Why do I have to understand the importance about this and why do I have the obligation to understand first what is CI/CD ? Of course, I am assuming that you know what DevOps is. But when I say "DevOps", I mean the truthful one. I am not referring to those cases where companies buy the most top existing tools on the market and think that all problems will be solved by these tools. I think, by my experience, that understand what DevOps really is the biggest challenge to be persued. That is the place where all the eyes should be and implement CI/CD comes next. So, this is my goal with this article, bring my point of view about what I believe to be DevOps, CI/CD and really understand what is the importance mentioned in article title.

So, what is DevOps ? In a really fast search on Google we can find the definition below:

"_DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from Agile methodology._"

But the point is: this definition doesn't help at all. Of course it doesn't help, it's to vague and of course it is vague, it's a cutout from Wikipedia. What were you expecting ? However, even if it is vague, it tells us some important things. DevOps wasn't born from one day to another. It has its foundations in others methodologies, as:
* Lean;
* Agile Manifesto;
* Agile Infrastructure and Velocity Moviment;
* Continuous Delivery (CD);
* Toyota Kata;

As you can see, it goes way further than a simple definition. Understand these methodologies is the key to understand DevOps and embrace it. I usually say that DevOps is a culture, but not only a culture, it is a lifestyle.

In a nutshell, Lean is focused in generating value to the final customer using the systemic way of thinking. It has a deep belief that demanded execution time of manufacture to convert raw material into finished products was the best quality and customer satisfaction predictor. It assumes shorter execution times were originated of small amounts of work. The Agile Manifesto, created in 2001, consists in a set of values and principles which oppose the heavy processes of software development. It has a important principle of delivering software frequently within a couple weeks or months.

The Agile Infrastructure and Velocity Moviment consists basically in a mobilization of important people to discuss the appliance of agiles principles on infrastructure instead of application source code, and how to create shared goals between Dev and Ops to deploy often.

Using the knowledge of building, testing and integrating continuously, Jez Humble and David Farley extended this whole concept to deliver continuously (CD) and create a new discipline in software engeneering. This practice defines a new implementation pipeline to ensure that source code and infrastructure are always implementable state.

Toyota Kata is a book written by Mike Rother that describes how he was surprised when he noticed that no companies of the automobile field achieved the same level of perfection that Toyota has and that's the target of this study. In this book he explains that each organization has its owns work routines, but to achieve perfection is necessary to create a structure focused on the daily practice of work improvement. And the truth is, you are already familiar with japanese practice of Kata.

Don't believe me !? See the picture below.

Everytime that you watched the movie Karate Kid, specially this scene or the training on the beach, you were being presented to the practice of Kata. The whole idea of Kata is technique improvement. So how DevOps can be achievable if we still don't incorporate this practice, which is by the way, one of the DevOps foundations ?

That should be very easy to answer. Without feedbacks and continuous learning principles DevOps isn't achievable at all. These two practices united with the flow principle compose the three pillars of DevOps.
