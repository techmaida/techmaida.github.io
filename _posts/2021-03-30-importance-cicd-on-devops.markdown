Understand the importance of CI/CD on DevOps is one of the major goals to be achieved when a company decides to implement the truthful DevOps. But, why's that ?

Why do I have to understand the importance about this and why do I have the obligation to understand first what is CI/CD ? Of course, I am assuming that you know what DevOps is. But when I say "DevOps", I mean the truthful one. I am not referring to those cases where companies buy the most top existing tools on the market and think that all problems will be solved by these tools. I think, by my experience, that understand what DevOps really is the biggest challenge to be persued. That is the place where all the eyes should be and implement CI/CD comes next. So, this is my goal with this article, bring my point of view about what I believe to be DevOps, CI/CD and really understand what is the importance mentioned in article title.
